    q1: "Is this a government app?",
    q1Answer:
      "No. The app is independent and doesnâ€™t have any ties to the government.",
    q2: "Why does the application require file access?",
    q2Answer:
      "The certificate and test documents are copied to the local application folder, allowing the application to function properly even if the user accidentally deletes the source file.",
    q3: "Is my data safe?",
    q3Answer:
      "Yes. All documents are stored locally on the user's device. The app does not connect to the internet, which makes it impossible for data to be leaked.",
    q4: "Why does the app require access to the camera?",
    q4Answer:
      "This permission is only required if the user wants to take a photo of the test result directly from the app. The camera is not accessed in any other case.",
